Task 2 SQL practice: Data operations and handling NULLs – Elevate Lab Internship

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation and management of a simple Hospital database using SQLiteStudio. 
The task was completed using **two approaches**:

1. **Manual SQL queries** – Writing SQL commands directly.
    - Wrote SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.  
    - Used conditions like `IS NULL`, and `DEFAULT`.
2. **GUI method** – Using DB Browser tool of SQL.

Both approaches were used to create tables, insert data, and perform updates and deletions.

## Why Both Approaches Are Useful

### Manual SQL Queries
1. Helps understand the syntax and logic of SQL.  
2. Offers full control over database operations.  
3. Useful for complex queries and automation.

### GUI Method
1. Easier and faster for beginners or small tasks.  
2. Provides a visual view of tables and relationships.  
3. Minimizes syntax errors and makes exploration simpler.
